# Online TicTacToe Frontend

## Description

This is a frontend for the Online TicTacToe project - you can play TicTacToe with your friends online by inviting them to your game. Can set up a game with board of any size and any winning condition in a row! The game is turn-based and you can play with multiple friends at the same time. The game is real-time and you will get a notification when it's your turn to play. Uses DFS to check for winning conditions. You can also play locally with a friend on the same device.

The frontend is built using React, Zustand, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, Pusher, React Query, and React Router. The backend is built using Go, Gin-Gonic, MongoDB, and Pusher. The backend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/gowth6m/online-tictactoe-backend)
